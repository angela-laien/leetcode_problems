# Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

# An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

# Input: x = 121
# Output: true

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        reversed = int((str(abs(x)))[::-1])
        if reversed == x:
            return True
        return False
